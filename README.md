# NumberGuessing
This is a basic number guessing game we used play while we were schooling. This was done to improve my JavaScript skill and this is customizable number guessing game which has two options as easily and hard play.
Further, if the difference between lower bound and upper bound is 'x' , you need maximum of log2(x) attempts to guess the number. This stategy is used when customized the game.
