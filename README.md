## Number Guessing Game

This includes one of the main games we played as kids. To understand and test the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS functionalities, extra functions were added to this one.

You must make a prediction about the computer-generated number using the offered feedback. The fundamental mathematical ideas behind the game can be described as follows.

In this game, you can set your own bounds by defining lower and upper limits. If the difference between the lower and upper bounds is "x," then log2(x) is the number of guesses that are needed the most. As a result, the "hard" mode will only offer log2(x) attempts and the easy mode will give you more chances to succeed (nearly double)
