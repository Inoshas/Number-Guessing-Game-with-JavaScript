# NumberGuessing
This is a customized version of the basic number guessing game. This was done to improve my JavaScript skill and this  has two options as easy and hard play.
Further, if the difference between lower bound and upper bound is 'x' , you need maximum of log2(x) attempts to guess the number. This stategy is used when customized the game.
